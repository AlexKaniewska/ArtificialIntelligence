# ArtificialIntelligence
Projects for artificial intelligence class.

1. Classification Project (Deep learning)
The purpose of the project is to select a database and apply machine learning, with particular emphasis on the task of classification.
[Data preprocessing, model, training and evaluation, model evaluation, analysis of the results, matching network parameters (layer activation functions), convolutional neural networks (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D).]
