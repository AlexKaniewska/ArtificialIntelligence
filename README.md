# ArtificialIntelligence
Projects for artificial intelligence class.

1. Classification Project (Deep learning)
The purpose of the project is to select a database and apply machine learning, with particular emphasis on the task of classification.
[Data preprocessing, model, training and evaluation, model evaluation, analysis of the results, matching network parameters (layer activation functions), convolutional neural networks (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D).]

2. Genetic Algorithm Project (solving linear equations) 
The purpose of the project is to solve problem (here find solution to linear equations) with a genetic algorithm and with another simple one algorithm (e.g. brute force).
[compare the effectiveness, algorithm optimization (mutation, crossover, population size, etc.)]
Example: for n = 5 and result = 20 --> 𝑎 + 2𝑏 + 3𝑐 + 4𝑑 + 5𝑒 = 20. The algorithm has to find the proper values of the parameters 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑, 𝑒.
